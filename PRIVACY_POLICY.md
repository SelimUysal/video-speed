# Privacy Policy

We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal information of users of our Chrome extension. This Privacy Policy outlines what data we collect, how it is used, and your rights in relation to that data. By using our extension, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Information Collection and Use

We do not collect any personally identifiable information (PII), including but not limited to:

- **Health Information**: No health-related data is collected.
- **Financial and Payment Information**: We do not collect any financial information, such as credit card details or payment information.
- **Authentication Information**: We do not collect usernames, passwords, or other authentication information.
- **Personal Communications**: We do not collect or monitor personal communications such as emails, text messages, or phone calls.
- **Location**: We do not track or collect your geographic location.
- **Web History**: We do not collect browsing history, including websites visited or interactions on those websites.
- **User Activity**: We do not track user activities, including clicks, scrolling, or any other interactions within the browser, except for functionality that is directly related to the purpose of the extension.
- **Website Content**: We do not capture or store the content of websites you visit.

## Data Collected for Extension Functionality

The extension only uses `chrome.local.storage` to store the user's current speed data. This data is used solely for the functionality of the extension and is automatically deleted when the browser is closed. Specifically:

- **User Speed Data**: The extension temporarily stores the user's current speed data in `chrome.local.storage` for the duration of the browsing session. This data is not shared, transferred, or stored permanently, and it is automatically removed when the browser or the Chrome tab is closed.

## Data Usage

The data we access is only used for the following purposes:

- **Extension Functionality**: The data stored in `chrome.local.storage` is used solely for providing the intended functionality (tracking and displaying user speed). No other data is collected or used for any purpose.

## Data Transfer and Sale

We do not sell, transfer, or share any user data to third parties. The stored speed data is only accessible by the extension and is automatically deleted at the end of the browser session. We do not use or transfer user data for any purposes unrelated to the extension's primary function.

## Security

We are committed to ensuring that any data accessed or stored by the extension is secure. Since no personally identifiable information is collected or retained, security risks are minimized. However, as with all data storage, there are inherent risks, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the extension or legal requirements. Any updates will be posted on this page, and we encourage you to review the Privacy Policy periodically. If significant changes are made, we will notify users through the extension or by other appropriate means.

## User Rights

As a user of our extension, you have the right to:

- **Opt-Out**: You may disable or uninstall the extension at any time if you do not agree with the terms outlined in this policy.
